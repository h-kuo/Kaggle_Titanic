# Kaggle Competition: Titanic Survival Prediction

This is my submission for the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

The goal is to predict each passenger's survival on Titanic using data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

For this competition, I've tried and compared several machine learning models, including 
- Logistic Regression 
- Random Forest 
- Support Vector Machine
